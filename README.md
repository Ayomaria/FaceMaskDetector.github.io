Features

The facemask detector is accurate and uses no dataset of altered masked photos. It is computationally effective since MobileNetV2 architecture is utilized.
With  the event Covid-19 outbreak, this technology can therefore be employed in real-time applications that demand face-mask detection for security reasons. To ensure that public safety regulations are obeyed, this project can be connected with embedded technologies for application at airports, train stations, offices, schools, and public spaces.



This dataset consists of 4095 images belonging to two classes:

with_mask: 2165 images
without_mask: 1930 images
The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:
